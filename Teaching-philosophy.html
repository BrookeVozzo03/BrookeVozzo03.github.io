												<h2>Who I am as a teacher:</h2>
												<p>
													As a Technology and Applied Studies (TAS) teacher, I am committed to fostering a learning environment where students not only acquire technical skills but also develop critical thinking, creativity, and a deep understanding of the world around them. My teaching philosophy is built on the belief that education in TAS subjects, such as Mandatory Technology, Textiles, Design and Technology, Food Technology, and Computing Studies, is not just about learning how to use tools and technologies, but about understanding the processes of innovation, problem-solving, and collaboration that are essential in today's rapidly evolving world.
												</p>
												<p>
												<h3>Student Centred learning</h3>
												I believe that every student has the potential to excel in TAS subjects, provided they are given the right support, encouragement, and opportunities to explore their interests. My goal is to create a classroom environment where students feel empowered to take ownership of their learning. I encourage students to engage in hands-on projects that are relevant to their lives, allowing them to see the real-world applications of what they are learning.
												</p>
												<p>
												<h3>Creativity and Innovation</h3> 
												In TAS education, creativity and innovation are significant. I strive to nurture these qualities in my students by providing them with opportunities to engage in design thinking and problem-solving activities. Whether itâ€™s designing a textile project, developing a new recipe in Food Technology, or creating a digital solution in Computing Studies, I challenge my students to think critically and creatively. I believe that the best learning occurs when students are encouraged to experiment, take risks, and learn from their failures. By fostering a growth mindset, I help students build resilience and confidence in their abilities.
										    	</p>
										        <p>
												<h3>Technology in the real world </h3>
												As a TAS teacher, I recognise the importance of integrating technology into the curriculum to prepare students for the future. I strive to incorporate the latest technological tools and resources into my lessons, ensuring that students are not only proficient in using these technologies but also understand their broader implications in society. I teach students how to approach problems methodically, use technology responsibly, and think ethically about the impact of their creations.
												</p>
												<p>
												<h3>Differentation </h3>
												I am deeply committed to providing an inclusive education that meets the diverse needs of all my students. I understand that students come to the classroom with varying levels of ability, interest, and learning styles, and I strive to differentiate my instruction to ensure that every student can achieve success. This includes providing additional support for students who need it, as well as offering extension activities for those who are ready to take on more challenging tasks.
