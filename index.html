											Hello! My name is Brooke Vozzo and I am an enthusiastic Third-Year Secondary Education University Student eager to contribute my passion for learning and commitment to educational excellence. I have extensive knowledge of the curriculum within a wide range of Technology and applied studies (TAS) subjects, and I am dedicated to fostering a positive and inclusive classroom environment. I possess strong communication skills, adaptability, and a genuine desire to support both students and educators in achieving their goals. I also  attempt to help to create a nurturing and productive educational experience for all.  <br/> <br/>

 I am studying a double degree at Australian Catholic University, a Bachelor of Secondary education, and Bachelor of Arts (Design and innovate technologies), by the end of my degree being qualified to teach stage 6 Textiles and Design/ Design and Technology, stage 5 in Food Technology and stage 4 mandatory technology.  <br/>  <br/>

Teaching has always been a passion for me, teaching my stuffed animals in primary school simple maths equations. As time went on, I expanded to teaching/ coaching 6 year olds Netball during early high school years. During senior highschool, my love for TAs subjects grew and was inspired to apply for early entry TAS teaching, influenced by my Textiles and Food Technology Teachers. I am now almost finished with my degree and am so passionate about sharing my knowledge to my students and collaborating with my peers/ colleagues  to constantly learn and foster a welcoming environment.
